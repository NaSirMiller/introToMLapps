Any work I have completed from my Intro to Machine Learning Applications Course at RPI

Final Project:
Problem Statement:
   Do external factors effect the stock market, if so, how much is performance affected
   Are the stock prices an indicator of the environment

   What we define as external factors:
      1. Politics
      2. Economy
      3. Physical environment
         -i.e. pollution
   We will look at the following external factors:
      1. Politics
         *Recent (2020 to 2023)
         -Israel-Palenstine conflict
         -Russian-Ukranian conflict
         *Historical
         - 
      2. Economy
         *Recent (2020 to 2023)
         - COVID-19
            a) Supply Chain issues caused
      3. Physical environment
         - Crackdown on combustion engine vehicles and push towards electric vehicles

What needs to be done:

   - Collect data from last year (historical data)
   - see how environment effects stock data

Where to find data:
- US Bureuau of labor statistics

Specific Ideas and scenarios:
1. Impact of pollution on stock prices
   *New Delhi
      --Flight delays

2. (Google) reviews impact on stock prices

3. BLM effects on black owned businesses
