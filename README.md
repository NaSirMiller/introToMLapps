Any work I have completed from my Intro to Machine Learning Applications Course at RPI

Final Project:
Problem Statement:
   Do external factors affect the stock market, if so, how much is performance affected
   Are the stock prices an indicator of the environment?

   What I define as external factors:
      1. Politics
      2. Economy
      3. Physical environment
         -i.e. pollution
   We will look at the following external factors:
      1. Politics
         *Recent & Significant (2020 to 2023)
         -Israel-Palenstine conflict
         -Russian-Ukranian conflict
      2. Economy
         *Recent (2020 to 2023)
         - COVID-19
            a) Supply Chain issues caused
      3. Physical environment
         - Crackdown on combustion engine vehicles and push towards electric vehicles
         - General environmental sentiment moving towards sustainability

   Datasets used:
      U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics-
      1. Core Consumer Price Index (CCPI)
      2. Environmental Consumer Price Index (ECPI)
      OECD Statistics-
      1. Environmental Policy Stringency Index(EPSI)
      Federal Reserve Bank of New York-
      1. Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI)

Improvements that I would make:
1. Address outliers properly
2. Develop method to remove duplicate countries-data datapoints
